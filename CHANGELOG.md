## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-XX

### üéâ Major Features

#### Integrated Web UI Dashboard
- **NEW**: Full-featured Next.js 15 web interface with real-time monitoring
- Interactive dashboard for launching agents from preset configurations
- Real-time chat interface with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
- Visual agent builder with YAML preview and export
- Session management UI for monitoring active containers
- File browser with syntax highlighting and ZIP download
- Tool execution panel showing real-time Bash commands and file operations
- Task tracking with TodoWrite integration

#### Agent Configuration System
- **NEW**: YAML-based agent configuration with 4 preset templates:
  - `code-assistant`: Full-stack development with comprehensive tooling
  - `research-agent`: Web research and information synthesis
  - `data-analysis`: Statistical analysis with Jupyter notebook support
  - `fullstack-team`: Multi-agent orchestration with specialized sub-agents
- Support for inline custom configurations via API
- Per-agent resource limits (CPU, memory, storage)
- MCP server integration for custom tool servers
- Multi-agent orchestration capabilities

#### Multi-Provider Support
- **NEW**: Provider abstraction layer for multi-platform deployment
- Docker provider (local development and self-hosted)
- Fly Machines provider (production deployments)
- HTTP/SSE communication protocol for universal compatibility
- Foundation for Cloudflare and Vercel providers

#### File Operations API
- **NEW**: Complete file management system for agent workspaces
- Browse workspace files in tree structure (`GET /api/files/{session_id}`)
- Preview files with syntax highlighting and image support
- Download individual files with proper MIME types
- Export entire workspace as ZIP archive
- Path traversal protection and zip bomb mitigation

### ‚ú® API Enhancements

#### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/agents/launch` - Launch agents from presets or inline configs
- `GET /api/agents/sessions` - List all active agent sessions
- `GET /api/agents/sessions/{session_id}` - Get session details
- `DELETE /api/agents/sessions/{session_id}` - Stop and remove session
- `POST /api/agents/{session_id}/chat` - Claude-native chat endpoint with SSE
- `GET /api/configs/` - List available agent configurations
- `GET /api/configs/{config_id}` - Get specific configuration details
- `GET /api/files/{session_id}` - Browse workspace files
- `GET /api/files/{session_id}/{path}` - Preview file content
- `POST /api/files/{session_id}/download` - Download workspace as ZIP

#### Breaking Changes
- **REMOVED**: `/chat/completions` OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  - **Migration**: Use `/api/agents/launch` + `/api/agents/{session_id}/chat` instead
  - New approach provides better session management and configuration control
- **CHANGED**: Session management now config-based instead of conversation-ID based
  - Sessions must be explicitly launched with a configuration
  - Auto-cleanup still active (30-minute idle timeout)
